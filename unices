things I have done to get the t410 up and running

edit /etc/rc.conf
	wifi stuff:
		wlans_iwn0="wlan0"
		ifconfig_wlan0="WPA SYNCDHCP"

	console resolution
		kld_list="i915kms" //what about what i did in /boot/loader.conf?

	dbus b/c xfce (or more?)
		dbus_enable="YES"
	
	to get trackpoint working right
		moused_enable="YES"
		moused_flags="-VH" // need to tweek

edit /boot/loader.conf
	enable vt for X/console transition smoothness
		kern.vty=vt

	enable sound device (assuming intel built-in, else see handbook)
		snd_hda_load="YES"
			and what else to make sound sane?
